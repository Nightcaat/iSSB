Nightcaat/iSSB
==============
An updated fork of the cross-platform *Super Smash Bros. Brawl* fangame that mostly serves to polish existing content.

This is the **main** branch, which is comprised of commits that are ready to be merged into the parent repository.

This project uses [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), so you may need to make Git clone recursively:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Nightcaat/iSSB
```
